# Counting Items in Refrigerator Images
Introduction
This Python code is designed to count the number of items in refrigerator images using object detection techniques. It uses a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model from PyTorch's torchvision library to detect objects within the images.

## Requirements
Before running the code, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

torch: PyTorch library for deep learning
torchvision: Part of PyTorch, used for computer vision tasks
opencv-python: OpenCV library for image processing
matplotlib: Library for displaying images and plots
You can install these libraries using pip if not already installed:
pip install torch torchvision opencv-python matplotlib


# Usage
Environment Setup:

Upload the refrigerator images you want to analyze to your Google Colab environment.
Install the required libraries as mentioned in the Requirements section.
Code Explanation:

The code is organized into functions to make it modular and easy to understand.
It loads an image, performs object detection, counts the detected items, and displays the image with bounding boxes around the items. 

## Object Detection:

The code uses a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model to detect objects in the image. This model is capable of identifying various items within the refrigerator.
Running the Code:

Replace 'path_to_image1.jpg' and 'path_to_image2.jpg' with the actual file paths of your refrigerator images.
Run the code in your Google Colab environment.
Output
The code displays the input image along with bounding boxes around detected items, labels for each item, and their confidence scores.
It also prints the total number of items detected in each image.
Example
Suppose you have two refrigerator images, 'image1.jpg' and 'image2.jpg'. After running the code with these images, it will display the images with bounding boxes and provide the count of items detected in each image.

## Note
Ensure that the images you provide for analysis are clear and well-lit for better object detection results.
You can modify the code to use different pre-trained models or adjust parameters as needed for your specific use case.
